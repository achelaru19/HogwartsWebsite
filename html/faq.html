				<h1>FAQ (Frequently-Asked-Questions)</h1>
				<h2>What is this website?</h2>
				<p>This is a school website of the fictional School of Witchcraft and Wizardry of Hogwarts. In this school, all the students are divided in four Houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Each House competes against each other for the House Cup. At the end of the year, the House with the most points wins. </p>
				<h2>What is the House Cup Tournament?</h2>
				<p>The House Cup is a yearly award at Hogwarts. It is given at the end of the school year to the House with the most House points. Points are given to Houses by teachers throughout the year for various things including answering questions correctly and doing good deeds. The winners of school Quidditch games also receive points. Points can be taken away for things such as misbehaving or rule-breaking.</p>
				<h2>What is the Quidditch Tournament?</h2>
				<p>Quidditch is a game that every student can play in their online page of this website. They have to catch the Golden Snitch, a little ball that changes its position at very high speed, three times in less than 10 seconds. If they do, their House gains a Quidditch Point. Every 2 months, the House that has the most Quidditch Points gains 50 points for the House Cup Tournament.</p>
				<h2>How do they log in?</h2>
				<p>Both teachers and students log in from the same page by checking "Student" or "Teacher" after typing their credentials.</p>

In this website, the teachers add a student by adding his/her information in the "Add Student" section. The new student will then receive an email of admission with his/her credentials for his/her first login.</p>
				<h2>What can students do?</h2>
				<p>Students can check how their House is doing compared to the other Houses.They can see their grades and their average. They can see the messages sent by their teachers and they can see the courses they have during their school career. Furthermore, they can play the Quidditch Game from their schoolpage.</p>
