	<h2> Ravenclaw </h2>

		<p id="p_house"> 
			Ravenclaw is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by 
			Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. 
			Its house colours are blue and bronze, and its symbol is an eagle. The house ghost, who in life 
			was the daughter of the house's founder Rowena Ravenclaw, is the Grey Lady.

			Ravenclaw roughly corresponds with the element of air; the House colours blue and bronze were chosen 
			to represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air.

	<h3>Common Room</h3>

		<p>
			The Ravenclaw common room is in one of the castle's towers and is wide and circular. 
			You have to climb a tight spiral staircase to get there. It has graceful arched windows, and the walls 
			are hung with blue and bronze silks. The domed ceiling is painted with stars, which are echoed in the 
			midnight-blue carpet. Tables, chairs, and bookcases cover the expanse of the floor, and a white-marble 
			statue of Rowena Ravenclaw sits next to the door that leads to the dormitories above. 

			Unlike the other common rooms in the school, a logical riddle given by a bronze eagle-shaped knocker 
			must be answered to enter. This could prove troublesome as anyone with enough intellect could intrude 
			into the dormitory, as is shown in 1998 where Professor McGonagall had no trouble entering by answering 
			the riddle correctly (though she was a "hatstall" between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw). However, Hermione 
			stated in her first year when figuring out the complicated riddle, beneath the trapdoor, that most 
			wizards and witches do not have much sense of logic, which might be something that Ravenclaw noticed 
			herself and decided to use clever riddles instead of passwords, as they are safer than some words.
