	<h2> Gryffindor </h2>

		<p id="p_house"> Gryffindor is one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded by Godric Gryffindor.
	 		Godric instructed the sorting hat to choose a few particular characteristics he most values.
	  		Such character traits of students Sorted into Gryffindor are courage, chivalry, and determination. 
	  		The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are red and gold.
	   		Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick" is the house ghost.

			Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire, and it is for that reason that the colours red and 
			gold were chosen to represent the House. The colour of fire corresponds to that of a lion as well, red 
			representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.

	<h3>Common Room</h3>

		<p>The Gryffindor Common Room is located in one of the castle's towers (Gryffindor Tower), the entrance to which is located on the seventh floor and is guarded by an oil painting of the Fat Lady, who is garbed in a pink silk dress. She permits entry only after being given the correct (regularly changing) password. 
	 		Behind her painting is a large common room, with a fireplace, and two staircases leading up to the girls' 
	 		and boys' dormitories.

			There is a spell on the girls' staircase that prevents boys from using it, however, 
			there is no such enchantment on the staircase to the boys' dormitory, allowing girls to use it whenever they wish, due to the founders' belief that girls were more trustworthy. The common room is very comfortable, 
			and members of the Gryffindor house meet there for study groups, celebrations, or relaxation. 
			The walls are lined with portraits, each one depicting a previous or current Head of Gryffindor.
